### Career Objective
I don't plan to write code my entire life, especially with recent trends in AI and ML. I aspire to extend my career far and wide to become a Site Reliability Engineer at a well established enterprise. Everyday am moving 1% ahead of 
in my progress. I foresee a world full of challenges that only humans percieve but with the help of modern tools we are able to tackle them with ease and fast.
